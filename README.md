# FlexArray
The FlexArray projects contains 4 classes. FlexArrayPrimitive.java contains useful methods for integer arrays, including adding new elements, getting the size of the array (the number of "active" or not null elements), checking if the array is empty, appending values to the array (and resizing the array if necessary), inserting elements at a specified point, deleting specific elements, getting the sum of the active elements (or sum of the lengths for rectangle objects), comparing elements, checking if two elements are equal, and sorting the array from least to greatest (or for rectangle, from least to greatest area).
